# What is an Everyday carry?

Everyone has a select few items that they take everywhere. Everyday carry (EDC) or every day carry refers to items that are carried on a consistent basis to assist in dealing with normal everyday needs of modern society. Some of the most common EDC items are knives, flashlights, multitools, wallets, smartphones, notebooks, and pens.

## Go Ruck: GR2

I have this pinned at the top because I always have a backpack with me. I love this bag for a few simple reasons, it promises rugged durability, opens completely flat and is unbranded. I could easily live out of a backpack and the GR2 gives me everything I need if that were ever the case.

## Baron Fig: Confidant and Vanguard Softcovers

I do a very poor job of documenting my ideas on my devices (I always seem to forget where I saved them.) so I like to always have something to scratch down ideas. The classic Moleskine notebook has always been my go to... but the Baron Fig Confidant caught my eye because of its cloth wrapped cover and folding flat design. I use it alongside a micron pen and a really rad mechanical pencil. When I don't have my bag with me I carry a little dotted Vanguard in its place.


## Leica: M6 Classic w/ Voigtlander 35mm Single Coated

I was drawn to the Leica M6 for its stealth. The ability to get the shot while not going largely unnoticed was the ultimate goal. It is not as expensive as its newer counterparts, it is tough, it is extremely well made, and it has everything that you could possibly need in a rangefinder camera.

## Apple: iPhone 7

Its a phone. It works.
