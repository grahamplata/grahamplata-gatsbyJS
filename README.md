# Graham Plata Personal Website `September 01, 2017`

## Purpose
Whenever I am learning something new I like to have a project to work on. As I strengthen my skills in Javascript I decided to build a personal website. The project is based off the default Gatsby starter.

## Technology
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) `JavaScript library for building user interfaces`
- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) `A static PWA (Progressive Web App) generator`
- [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) `A simple CSS framework`
- [TypographyJS](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) `A powerful toolkit for building websites with beautiful design.`
